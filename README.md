VimIM
=====

Next-Gen VimIM, vim build-in ``IME UI'', with multi-engine support.
It provide a build-in user interface which is friendly with different
mode in vim for inputting multi-byte languages (e.g. Chinese and Japanese).

As is known, this function is provided by IME on PCs, but IME do not
get along with vim very well. This plugin, will let you get rid of
using the traditional IMEs inside vim. It provides some other cool
features too. :)

(which is almost frozen AFAIK) or this one.
Most of the code in this plugin are rewritten,
